As an international student in the USA myself, I was curious if foreign learners participating in the Erasmus program were prone to participating in the program whilst hosted by their home countries. It turns out this was not the case. Of all the participants of Erasmus between the years 2014 to 2020, 6039 individuals were at a home institution that differed from the participant's nationality (foreign). Of those, 5939 completed their Erasmus program within the same country as their home institution (this is the trend with non-foreign learners as well) and 1100 decided to travel aborad. Of those who traveled abroad, 910 learners (83%) travelled to a third country that differed from their nationality and the location of their home institution. 

From this chart, we can see that many such students choose to do their Erasmus program in France, while France itself did not send many foreign students to a different country. Another interesting example would be Germany and The Netherlands, each sending foreign students to another country, but not accepting any. On the other side of the spectrum, Romania did not have any foreign students who went aborad to a different country than their nationality, yet they accepted many from Hungary and France.

This is a unique subset of the total Erasmus dataset. Who knows how interesting it is to other people, bout I'd love to think that those who already went through the effort to study aborad as a learner are keen to continue traveling when participating in Erasmus.
