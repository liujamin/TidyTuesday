# Baby Names in the USA
Playing catch up as usual, where I missed last week's Tidy Tuesday. Better late than never I suppose. I remember last week I saw many people look into the influence of Disney on baby names, which was super cool. So I thought to myself, what else was a huge cultural influence in the past years? Well, Harry Potter of course! So I went to the [Harry Potter wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter) to look at some of the main characters' names.

So the first Harry Potter book came out in 1997 and the final book was in 2007 (a whole decade!). The first movie came out in 2001 and the final part of the final movie came out in 2011. So if we were to assume that the target audience were children in middle and high school when the books came out, then if these individuals were to name their babies after their favorite characters, those babies would be born shortly after then 2000s. 

## Harry Potter Female Names

Let's start with the female names:

* As we can see, Hermione wasn't a common name at all in the 1950s forward. However, shortly after the 2000s, there is a huge burst of approximately 50 babies a year being named Hermione. Understandable! She was an incredibly smart and awesome character.

* Another fan-favorite character was Luna Lovegood. Luna also was not a particularly common name in the past but shortly after the 2000s experienced an exponential growth in popularity that is ongoing today. 

* Ginny is an old name, and has only decreased in popularity. I suppose she wasn't always the most popular Harry Potter character and so her name did not see an increase in prevalence due to the franchise.

* Minerva is a very old name. I personally really like it, but it too did not see much of an increase in popularity, but there is still hope. There is perhaps a little blip right around 2015?

* Lily was a name that was already regaining popularity prior to the 2000s but that growth continued exponentially! For a character who had already passed away (spoilers but not really) and who did not experience much character development (due to being dead), this name has really stuck around and regained popularity.

* Props to whoever decided to name their kid Bellatrix. You know she was like a terrible villain right? Perhaps her actress, Helena Bonham, did too good of a job.

* Dolores, another reviled villain of the franchise, did not experience an increase in popularity. Rightly so.

## Harry Potter Male Names

Now for the male characters:

* In general, most male names did not experience a huge burst of popularity just following the 2000s. Harry, Ron, Neville, Fred, George, and Cedric all followed the general downward trend.

* For all you Hagrid lovers out there, you're really letting Rubeus down. No child was named Rubeus in the USA.

* Names of the two headmasters, Albus and Severus, both experienced a brief boom of existence in the late 2010s and then once again disappeared into oblivion

* Draco as a name also saw a steady increase in prevalence, as did Sirius and Remus, in the 2000s.
