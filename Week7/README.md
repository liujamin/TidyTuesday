## Data Availability
Data available in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/ajstarks/dubois-data-portraits/tree/master/challenge/2022).
## Notes
It appears that there were some errors in the original dataset that made recorded the western part of the USA as having the incorrect population numbers. I have corrected this data (available in this repo under [data_corrected.csv](https://github.com/liujamin/TidyTuesday/blob/main/Week7/data_corrected.csv)) that was manually curated using the original W.E.B. DuBois visualization.
